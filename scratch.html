        <h2>Skiing at Grand Targhee</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite ski resort is the resort I grew up skiing at: Grand Targhee.
          It consistently has fantastic snow, great access to backcountry terrain, and it’s
          small enough that even though it’s on the other side of Jackson, the lift lines
          usually aren’t terrible. Some of my favorite memories are from when I was
          basically two years old and up, skiing there with my family. There’s something
          special about riding the same lifts and runs year after year and having all
          those shared stories on the mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page is just a place to talk about that and, at the same time, show that I
          can actually write HTML and CSS from scratch for this class.

          This is a ski video that matches the feeling I love about being on the mountain.
